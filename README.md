How to run the test : 
    Run the main.py 
        if the output of 2 algorithm (minsum and brute force) is the same , print out "success" , the min sum algorithm is correct for all the testcase
        else if there is a testcase that the 2 output are not the same, it will print out the testcase that failed

the implementation of brute force algorithm is in the brute_force.py

the implementation of minimal sum algorithm is in the min_sum.py

the testcase is in the tescase folder 

the output files in the output folder will list the minimal sum of each testcase
